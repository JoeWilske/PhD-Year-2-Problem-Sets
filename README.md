# PhD-Year-2-Problem-Sets

This repository contains the (functioning) code that I wrote for my Industrial Organization and Panel Econometrics classes in the second year of my PhD. Most, if not all, of the code is in Julia. I was learning Julia as I took IO 1, so there is an obvious improvement in the quality of the code from the first problem set to the last.
